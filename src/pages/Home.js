        <p className="paragraph">
          At early stage of my life while growing up as a young man, I had zeal
          for craft that made me to acquire a degree in Electrical Engineering.
          During knowledge acquisition, I have passion for computer hardware,
          software configuration and installation more also in wide Format
          industry. I have over 12 years experience in Large Format industry and
          I have not only installed a lots of printers locally but also in the
          nearest neighbouring countries. With my skills, I have helped many
          countless companies to resolve issues on their machines either on site
          or remote diagnostic support to reduce downtime by making them to stay
          in business.

          Also I have installed, configured and troubleshoot computers on the
          network. Besides, I have worked on different printer's control
          software and many raster image processing software. I carry out
          preventative maintenance on printers, break - fix printers,
          troubleshoot printer's software remotely using team-viewer and anydesk
          applications, spare parts ordering, counsel owner's investment making
          them to have right choice when purchasing machines and how to prolong
          lifespan of their equipment. I seek opportunity as a field service
          technician or computer user support...

          Currently, I enroll in a six-month intensive Coding Bootcamp Course with Trilogy with the
          affiliation of UNB and I will be concluding the course in less than a
          month from now. Therefore, I am an up coming front-end developer.
